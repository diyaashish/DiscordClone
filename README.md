# DiscordClone

#**Description**
This project is an exact clone of the popular chat and communication platform Discord. It is built using JavaScript (React), HTML, and CSS for the frontend, with Redux for state management. The project also utilizes Firebase for real-time database and user authentication.

The goal of this project was to replicate the key features and user interface of Discord, allowing users to create servers, channels, and interact with each other through text messaging and voice calls.



#**Features**
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out using their Google account through Firebase Authentication.

Real-time Messaging: Messages are sent and received in real-time using Firebase Firestore, allowing for instant communication between users.

Server and Channel Creation: Users can create servers and channels within those servers to organize conversations effectively.

Text Messaging: Users can send text messages within channels and view messages in real-time.

Redux State Management: Redux is used to manage the global state of the application, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience.
